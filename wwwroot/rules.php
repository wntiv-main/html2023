					The Senior Formal is a school event; therefore the usual rules apply regarding behaviour and banned
					substances, including vapes. As with all school functions for students there will be no alcohol at
					this event. Any student who brings alcohol or who arrives under the influence of alcohol will not be
					allowed to attend and may face school disciplinary action.
